## 🤔 What is Information Theory?

Information Theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering that involves quantifying information. Proposed by Claude Shannon in 1948, it provides a framework for understanding how information is measured, stored, and transmitted.

Key concepts include:

- **Entropy:** A measure of uncertainty or randomness in a set of data.
- **Shannon's Information:** The amount of uncertainty reduced or information gained by learning the outcome of a random variable.
- **Channel Capacity:** The maximum rate of reliable information transfer over a communication channel.

## 💻 What is Coding?

Coding, in the context of Information Theory, refers to the process of representing data using a specific code. This is essential for error detection and correction, compression, and secure communication. There are two main types of coding:

- **Source Coding (Data Compression):** Reducing the number of bits required to represent information.
- **Channel Coding (Error Correction):** Adding redundant information to detect and correct errors during data transmission.
